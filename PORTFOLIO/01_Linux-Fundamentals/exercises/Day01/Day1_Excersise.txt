Today's excercise was to create this sample company directory in Linux:

company/
├── hr/
│   ├── employees.txt
│   └── payroll.csv
├── it/
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   ├── backup.sh
│   │   └── cleanup.sh
│   └── logs/
│       └── auth.log
└── sales/
    ├── leads.csv
    └── regions/
        ├── east.txt
        ├── west.txt
        └── south.txt


Then:

Add text inside at least 3 files
(Files chosen: employees.txt, backup.sh, east.txt)

Use ls -R company to view the full tree

Delete one folder & restore it
(Created north.txt, removed it, then restored it)
