TODAY'S EXERCISE WAS TO LOG INTO A SYSTEM REMOTELY USING SSH

1.) CREATE USER ON TARGET SYSTEM

sudo adduser agent1

2.) ENABLE SSH SERVICE ON TARGET

sudo systemctl status ssh

[ IF INACTIVE ]:
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh

(My ubuntu didn't have ssh enabled/installed by default)

3.) GENERATE SSH ON CLIENT SYSTEM

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
(Pop ups occur / I selected defaults)

[Verified Keys]
Location : ~/.ssh/id_rsa & ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Vim in and verify the keys are there


4.) SEND PUBLIC KEY TO CLIENT

ssh-copy-id agent1@192.168.198.6

5.) TEST PASSWORDLESS LOGIN

ssh agent1@192.168.198.6
