Nano editor is what I have experience in and is very simple and self explanatory

Today I learned about Vim and it's basics

VIM Basics:

Modes:
- Normal Mode (default) - navigation & commands
- Insert Mode - typing text
- Command Mode - saving/quitting

Essential Keys:

- i -> insert mode
- Esc -> return to normal mode
- :w -> write (save)
- :q -> quit
- :wq -> save and quit
- dd -> delete line
- yy -> yank (copy)
- p -> paste

IF YOU GET STUCK
Esc :q! (quit without saving)

Confusion & Mistakes

- Obviously VIM took a couple minutes to get used to
- Was a little rusty traversing through directories, but it came back and I    enterered flow state
- When creating nested directories I created a directory within the
  directory of the same name
  
      IE: mkdir -p company/hr
      (While I am already in the company directory)

OVERALL, Great first day!
