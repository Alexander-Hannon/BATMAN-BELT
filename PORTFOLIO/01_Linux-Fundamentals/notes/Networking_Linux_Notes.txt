NETWORKING ON LINUX

Focus: Network visibility, sockets, connection, logging

------------------------------------------

Commands:

ip addr
- Displays network interfaces and assigned IP addresses
- Preferred modern replacement for ifconfig

ip route
- Shows routing table
- Identifies default gateway and packet paths

ifconfig
- Legacy interface tool
- Still appears on older systems and documentation

ss -tunap
- Displays active TCP/UDP sockets
- Shows process ownership of connections
- Faster and more modern than netstat

netstat -tulnp
- Legacy networking tool
- Useful for reading older guides and reports


-------------------------------------------------

KEY CONCEPTS:

- Difference between listening vs established connections
- Importance of identifying which process owns a network socket
- Why ESTABLISHED state is most useful for incident investigation
- Why numeric output (-n) avoids DNS resolution delays

-------------------------------------------------

LOGGING & AUTOMATION INSIGHTS:

- Logs should be structured for readability and future parsing
- Idempotent logging prevents duplicate noise
- Footer reminders should be controlled, not duplicated
- sed is regex-based, not string-based
- Special characters (*, +, etc.) must be handled carefully

------------------------------------------------

REAL WORLD USE:

This script could be used by:
- SOC analysts for host-level network visibility
- Incident responders during active investigations
- Baseline creation for normal vs suspicious behavior
