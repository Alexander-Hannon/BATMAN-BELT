Today I went over Systemctl and Journalctl

SYSTEMCTL:

Used systemctl to start/stop/restart/enable/disable/list services on my Kali VM

The most interesting aspect was the enable and disable on boot. As you use a computer regularly,
you don't really take the time to think "Wow, this software/service is automatically enabled when 
I start up my system.

JOURNALCTL:

Used journalctl to view the logs for specific services such as:
    -SSH
    -NetworkManager
    -Apache2

Viewed logs only from Today
Viewed live logs
Filtered logs by time
Filtered logs by priority/severity

* Thought that it was interesting that the usual log files in /var/log aren't there in more 
"modern" systems. My Kali VM doesn't include these files and only really uses Journalctl
