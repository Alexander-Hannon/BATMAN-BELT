AWS IAM Fundamentals
--------------------------

What IAM Is

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is ther service used to
control who can access AWS resources and what actions they are
allowed to perform.

IAM does not manage resources themselves - it manages authentication
and authorization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM Core Components

IAM Users
    - Represent individual people or applications
    - Can authenticate using:
        * Console password
        * Access keys (programmatic)
    - Best practice: users should not have permissions attached directly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM Groups
    - Logical collection of IAM users
    - Permissions are attached to the groups 
    - Users inherit permissions through group membership

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM Roles
    - Do not have long-term credentials
    - Are assumed temporarily
    - Commonly used by:
        * EC2 instances
        * Lambda functions
        * Cross-account access
    - Preferred over access keys for automation and services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM Policies
    - JSON documents that define permissions
    - Specify:
        * Effect (Allow/Deny)
        * Actions (API calls)
        * Resources (ARNs)
    - Policies answer: "Who can do what on which resource"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Least Privilege Priniple

Least privilege means granting only the permissions required to perform
a task - nothing more.

Benefits:
    - Reduces blast radius
    - Limits privilege escalation
    - Prevents lateral movement
    - Mitigates impact of credential compromise

Most real-world AWS breaches are caused by overly permissive IAM Policies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group-Based Permission Management

Best practice:
    - Attach policies to groups
    - Add users to groups
    - Avoid attaching policies directly to users

Reasons:
    - Easier auditing
    - Consistent access control
    - Faster permission changes
    - Reduced configuration errors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read-Only vs Administrative Access

Read-only access:
    - Allows visibility into resources
    - Prevents creation, modification, or deletion
    - Commonly used for:
        * Security audits
        * SOC analysis
        * Monitoring Roles

Administrative access should be tightly controlled and rarely assigned.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why IAM Roles Are Safer Than Access Keys 

Access keys:
    - Long-lived credentials
    - Easily leaked or committed accidentally
    - Difficult to rotate at scale

IAM roles:
    - Temporary credentials
    - Automatically rotated
    - Scoped to specific services or tasks
    - Strongly preferred for AWS services and automation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security Relevance

IAM is the primary security boundary in AWS

Misconfigured IAM can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access
    - Privilege escalation
    - Data exfiltration
    - Full account compromise

Understanding IAM is critical for cloud security, SOC operations, and 
incident response.
